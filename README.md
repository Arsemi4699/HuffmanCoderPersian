# Huffman Coder for Persian Characters

## Introduction
This project implements a Huffman coding algorithm specifically designed for Persian characters. Huffman coding is a popular algorithm for lossless data compression, which assigns variable-length codes to input characters based on their frequencies. Characters with higher frequencies are assigned shorter codes, resulting in efficient compression.

This implementation aims to provide an efficient way to compress and decompress text data in the Persian language, leveraging the unique characteristics of the language to achieve optimal compression ratios.

## Features
- Efficient compression and decompression of Persian text
- Support for almost all common Persian characters
- Huffman Tree generation for educational goals


## Installation
To use this Huffman coder, you only need to have Python installed on your system. You can download Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).
